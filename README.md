# Journal-Together-Club
Journal Together Club is UIC's very first Scrapbooking &amp; Journaling Club! ðŸ’— We want to create a community where students can explore their creativity, find their interests, and make meaningful connections with one another through scrapbooking &amp; journaling together.
