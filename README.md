# Journal Together Club
Journal Together Club is UIC's very first Scrapbooking &amp; Journaling Club! 

ðŸ’— We want to create a community where students can explore their creativity, find their interests, and make meaningful connections with one another through scrapbooking &amp; journaling together. 

ðŸ’— We plan to organize events like scrapbooking picnics, journaling dates at local cafes & boba shops, DIY craft workshops, and casual journaling/scrapbooking meetups!
